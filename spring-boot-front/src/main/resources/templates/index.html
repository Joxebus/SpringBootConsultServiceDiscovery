    <h1>Spring Boot + Consul for service discovery</h1>

    <p>This project is an example of how to get running Spring Boot with Consul</p>

    <h3>Consul</h3>
    <p>
        Consul is a distributed service mesh to connect, secure, and configure services across any runtime platform and public or private cloud.
    </p>

    <h3>Spring Boot Cloud Consul</h3>
    <p>
        Spring Cloud Consul provides Consul integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and
        other Spring programming model idioms. With a few simple annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns inside your
        application and build large distributed systems with Hashicorp's Consul. The patterns provided include Service Discovery, Distributed Configuration and Control Bus.
